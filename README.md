# Keyboards

All of my custom keyboards, keymaps, and case files are stored here.

# Branches
- [main](https://github.com/joe-scotto/keyboards/main) - Case files and firmware for keyboards designed by me.
- [other](https://github.com/joe-scotto/keyboards/other) - Case files designed by me for keyboards not designed by me.

# FAQ
- Can I sell any of these keyboards?
  - <ins>**No, absolutely not**</ins>. I release these for free so people can build them, not sell them. Refer to the license below or on each keyboard for specifics.
- Why do you use so many standoffs and screws in your builds?
  - Since my boards use 3D printed plates, this gives them much better stability. It also helps improve stabilizer performance for keys that require them.
- How exactly do I build a handwired keyboard?
  - I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjml-K-pV4E) explaining everything you need to know.
- Why is `qmk compile` not working?
  - This most likely means the board hasn't been merged into the [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) repo yet. If this is the case, you can simply copy the `QMK` folder into `qmk_firmware/keyboards/handwired/jscotto` and rename it to the respective keyboard.
