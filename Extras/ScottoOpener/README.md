# ScottoOpener

Keyswitch openers for Cherry MX or Kailh. Either print it yourself, or purchase [here](https://scottokeebs.com/products/switch-opener).

These are best printed in resin, not FDM and because they endure a bit of abuse you should use something tough such as [Siraya Tech Blu](https://amzn.to/3q3jf1U).
