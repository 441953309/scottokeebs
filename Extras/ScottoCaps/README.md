# ScottoCaps

Low-profile flat Cherry MX keycaps designed for FDM 3D printing. Keep in mind that the stems can be fragile and snap if you use too low of a printing temperature or matte filament.

I recommend using the "Fuzzy Skin" setting in Cura for a cleaner look in addition to using a [textured PEI build plate](https://amzn.to/43r18ka)
