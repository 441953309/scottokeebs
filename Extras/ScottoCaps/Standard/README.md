# ScottoCaps (Standard)

Low-profile flat Cherry MX keycaps designed for FDM 3D printing. I recommend using the "Fuzzy Skin" setting in Cura for a cleaner look in addition to using a [textured PEI build plate](https://amzn.to/43r18ka). Also, keep in mind that using matte filament will likely make the stem fragile. It is possible to use them with fragile stems because normal use doesn't put too much off-axis force but just be aware that you might need extras. If you are having a very hard time getting the stems to print, increase your temperature to help the layer adhere to one another.

**These are skewed -0.875Â° to counteract misalignment between keys**
