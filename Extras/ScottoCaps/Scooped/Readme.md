# ScottoCaps (Scooped)

Scooped Cherry MX keycaps designed for FDM 3D printing. The legend variant of these are specifically designed for a printer capable of dual extrusion, you cannot print the legends on a single extruder printer. I recommend putting the back of the keycap towards the build plate. By doing this, you'll hide any texture on the back of the cap where it won't be as visible.

-   **Legends:** SF Pro Rounded
-   **Legend Height:** ~6mm
-   **Keycap Dimensions:** 18x18x7.3mm

# Stems

The stems are designed based on a tolerance of ~0.15mm, your printer may or may not be capable of handling this. If your keycaps are too tight, you can use some hot water to make the plastic more pliable when installing them. If they are too loose, you can cut [Kapton tape](https://amzn.to/45GeFFr) and use it between the keycap and switch to improve the fit.

**Don't force them onto your switches as if they're too tight, it will be very hard to get them off.**
