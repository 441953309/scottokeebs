# ScottoBender

A wire bending tool for keyboards such as the [ScottoFly](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/keyboards/scottofly-handwired-keyboard) or [ScottoErgo](https://scottokeebs.com/blogs/keyboards/scottoergo-handwired-keyboard). You will need [16g](https://amzn.to/3OyQrq8) and [18g](https://amzn.to/3KNlCwH) wire in order to build it, along with some glue.

**Should be printed in a tough 3D printing resin such as [Siraya Tech Blu](https://amzn.to/3seh5Nt)**
