# <b>Iris V4</b>

Included in this repo are all the files and parts I used for my Keebio Iris V4 build. I also have included the prices I paid excluding shipping and taxes. All together the board costed me roughly \$300 (USD) with shipping.

## <i><b>Parts</b></i>

Keep in mind this board is a pretty well known design and you don't have to get the case from keeb.io, there are many options of 3D printed cases and laser cut.

## <i><b>Tools</b></i>

This board is fairly basic when it comes to DIY boards, pretty much all you have to do is solder the switches and assemble the case. Because of this, you don't really need that many tools but listed here are what I use when building my boards.

1. Hakko FX888D
2. Velleman VTDESOL3U
3. Kester 24-6337-0027 Solder

## <i><b>Keymaps</b></i>

The default layer is pretty standard with the only excpetion being command is on caps lock and escapse is on the right shift. Layer 1 is where things get a bit more complicated and maps a majority of prgramming and media keys.
